<p> There once was a wizard who felt she was the most critical member of the party. She would run in and throw fireballs around the room when they entered a chamber. Not paying attention to the other party members or the traps and treasures. This left a bad taste with the rest of the party regarding having her join in. Most of the party would prefer to leave her behind, but they needed a magic user, so they were stuck with her. Of course, being the wizard, she was oblivious to any of this and believed they were standoffish due to her remarkable abilities. This attitude was the catalyst to her finding herself in a most awkward position</p>
<p> The party was walking by a small hedge that started to sparkle and rang faintly of bells. The rest of the party backed off and started to give the hedge a generous berth but not the wizard. She was telling the druid once again how more important her magic was than his when a tiny hedgehog ran out and stopped right in front of her baring its teeth. She laughed at the little beast. Now, this is when a wise individual would take stock and pause, this is not what she did, however. As a matter of fact, she laughed harder as it started to hiss.</p>

    <p>“You will pay for your pride and impertinence!” She exclaimed. With that, the young wizard found that she was no longer the tall, beautiful woman she had been but a small Rhode Island Red hen. “You will remain in this form until you fulfill these three requirements. </p>

   <p>Then, the tiny hedgehog disappeared and, with it, the hedge that it came out of. What will become of the little red hen?</p>
